Yey This is my first git repository
Hopefull will use it for all my normal daily how-tos and notes.
Would be fantastic if i can get access to them from everywhere all time and have the history of the updates too.
Also who knows this might make it easier to get back to programming more seriously too.
thats enough bs for now. lets see what a commit is.
This is even some more changes
