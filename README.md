Yey This is my first git repository
Hopefull will use it for all my normal daily how-tos and notes.
Would be fantastic if i can get access to them from everywhere all time and have the history of the updates too.
Also who knows this might make it easier to get back to programming more seriously too.
thats enough bs for now. lets see what a commit is.
This is even some more changes .

hashtag is everywhere these days. Last time i didnt add the fix to issue #1 in the title so it didnt close the issue automatically. This time will see how it goes!
<<<<<<< HEAD
Now it is cloned on the local git i have on my PRJ3 laptop
=======

Now checking out this markdown thing. 
Below is a list of stuff:
- [ ] Do this
- [ ] Then do this
- [x] have done this already

Cool.
Now make a table as below:

| Item | Name | Description |
|:------:|:------|---------------:|
| 1 | First Item | Desc of first Item |
|2|Second Item|Desc of Second Item|

And below is an example of how codes should look like:

````
$su -
#yum install git

````

Back to normal text.
